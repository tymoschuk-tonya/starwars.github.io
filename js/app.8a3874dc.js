In 19 BBY, Kenobi destroyed General Grievous, effectively ending the Clone Wars. By then, however, Order 66 was activated by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, which resulted in the clone troopers turning against their Jedi officers. Kenobi survived Codys betrayal, only to discover that Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force as Darth Vader. A fateful battle ensued between the former friends, and ended with Kenobi leaving Vader to die on Mustafar. With the Jedi all but extinct, Kenobi exiled himself to Tatooine where he lived as a hermit for two decades.During the Galactic Civil War, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan was captured by the Galactic Empire while attempting to recruit Kenobi for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Kenobi chose to answer the Alliances plea for help, and also began training Vaders son, Luke Skywalker, who sought to become a Jedi like his father before him. Their time together was cut short, however, as Kenobi sacrificed himself to protect Skywalker. Vader struck down his former master, but ultimately death was not the end for Kenobi, having preserved his consciousness as a Force spirit. He would continue to watch over Skywalker, guiding him on his path to knighthood and beyond.",photo:[{img:"https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp4581080.jpg"},{img:"https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp4581096.jpg"},{img:"https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp4581100.jpg"}]}],humasArray:[],resultArray:[],colorFilterArray:[],ageFilterArray:[],heightFilterArray:[],photoArray:[{name:"BeruWhitesunlars",photo:"Beru Whitesun lars.jpg"},{name:"BiggsDarklighter",photo:"Biggs Darklighter.jpg"},{name:"C3PO",photo:"C-3PO.png"},{name:"DarthVader",photo:"Darth Vader.jpg"},{name:"LeiaOrgana",photo:"Leia Organa.jpg"},{name:"LukeSkywalker",photo:"Luke Skywalker.jpg"},{name:"ObiWanKenobi",photo:"Obi-Wan Kenobi.jpg"},{name:"OwenLars",photo:"Owen Lars.jpg"},{name:"R2D2",photo:"R2-D2.jpg"},{name:"R5D4",photo:"R5-D4.jpeg"}]},mutations:{SET_HUMANS_TO_STATE:function(e,a){0==e.resultArray&&(e.isLoading=!0),e.humasArray=a;for(var t=0;t<e.humasArray.length;t++)for(var i=0;i<e.humasArray.length;i++)e.humasArray[t].name.replace(/-|\s/g,"")==e.photoArray[i].name&&(e.humasArray[t].human_photo=e.photoArray[i].photo);e.resultArray=a,e.colorFilterArray=a,e.ageFilterArray=a,e.heightFilterArray=a,0!=e.resultArray&&(e.isLoading=!1)},SET_COLOR_FILTER:function(e,a){e.colorFilterArray="all"==a?e.humasArray:e.humasArray.filter((function(e){return e.eye_color==a}))},SET_AGE_FILTER:function(e,a){e.ageFilterArray=e.humasArray.filter((function(e){return"unknown"===e.birth_year||e.birth_year.replace(/[^\d.-]/g,"")>=a.minAgeValue&&e.birth_year.replace(/[^\d.-]/g,"")<=a.maxAgeValue}))},SET_HEIGHT_FILTER:function(e,a){e.heightFilterArray=e.humasArray.filter((function(e){return e.height>=a.minHeightvalue&&e.height<=a.maxHeightvalue}))},SET_FILTERS:function(e){document.body.style.overflow="hidden",e.isLoading=!0,e.resultArray=[];for(var a=0;a<e.colorFilterArray.length;a++)for(var t=0;t<e.heightFilterArray.length;t++)for(var i=0;i<e.ageFilterArray.length;i++)e.colorFilterArray[a]===e.heightFilterArray[t]&&e.colorFilterArray[a]===e.ageFilterArray[i]&&e.heightFilterArray[t]===e.ageFilterArray[i]&&e.resultArray.push(e.ageFilterArray[i]);function r(){e.isLoading=!1,document.body.style.overflow="auto"}setTimeout(r,500)},SET_SORT_BY:function(e,a){function t(){e.isLoading=!1,document.body.style.overflow="auto"}document.body.style.overflow="hidden",e.isLoading=!0,"age"==a?e.resultArray.sort((function(e,a){return a.birth_year.replace(/[^\d.-]/g,"")-e.birth_year.replace(/[^\d.-]/g,"")})):"mass"==a?e.resultArray.sort((function(e,a){return a.mass-e.mass})):"height"==a&&e.resultArray.sort((function(e,a){return a.height-e.height})),setTimeout(t,500)}},actions:{GET_HUMANS_LIST:function(e){var a=e.commit;return ue.a.get("https://swapi.dev/api/people").then((function(e){a("SET_HUMANS_TO_STATE",e.data.results)})).catch((function(e){console.log(e)}))},COLOR_FILTER:function(e,a){var t=e.commit;t("SET_COLOR_FILTER",a),t("SET_FILTERS")},AGE_FILTER:function(e,a){var t=e.commit;t("SET_AGE_FILTER",a),t("SET_FILTERS")},HEIGHT_FILTER:function(e,a){var t=e.commit;t("SET_HEIGHT_FILTER",a),t("SET_FILTERS")},SORT_BY:function(e,a){var t=e.commit;t("SET_SORT_BY",a)}},getters:{HUMANS_ARRAY:function(e){return e.humasArray},REZULT_ARRAY:function(e){return e.resultArray},LOADING:function(e){return e.isLoading},PERSON_ONE_ARRAY:function(e){return e.morePersonInfoAArray}}}),ge=(t("73ec"),t("5f5b"));t("f9e3"),t("2dd8");i["default"].use(ge["a"]),i["default"].config.productionTip=!1,new i["default"]({router:de,store:me,render:function(e){return e(d)}}).$mount("#app")},"5e2b":function(e,a,t){var i={"./Beru Whitesun lars.jpg":"7ece","./Biggs Darklighter.jpg":"eba5","./C-3PO.png":"c4e2","./Darth Vader.jpg":"45fd","./Leia Organa.jpg":"0681","./Luke Skywalker.jpg":"321f","./Obi-Wan Kenobi.jpg":"1e62","./Owen Lars.jpg":"cab9","./R2-D2.jpg":"6b38","./R5-D4.jpeg":"3b6b"};function r(e){var a=n(e);return t(a)}function n(e){if(!t.o(i,e)){var a=new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'");throw a.code="MODULE_NOT_FOUND",a}return i[e]}r.keys=function(){return Object.keys(i)},r.resolve=n,e.exports=r,r.id="5e2b"},6648:function(e,a,t){"use strict";t("210f")},"6b38":function(e,a,t){e.exports=t.p+"img/R2-D2.7ecc0358.jpg"},"73ec":function(e,a,t){},"7ece":function(e,a,t){e.exports=t.p+"img/Beru Whitesun lars.63f330cb.jpg"},"8b91":function(e,a,t){"use strict";t("b639")},"968b":function(e,a,t){},"96ff":function(e,a,t){},"97c2":function(e,a,t){},ab46:function(e,a,t){"use strict";t("968b")},b639:function(e,a,t){},b9d6:function(e,a,t){},b9fb:function(e,a,t){"use strict";t("3b46")},c4e2:function(e,a,t){e.exports=t.p+"img/C-3PO.68d75aa6.png"},cab9:function(e,a,t){e.exports=t.p+"img/Owen Lars.bb5a762c.jpg"},d49c:function(e,a,t){"use strict";t("b9d6")},eba5:function(e,a,t){e.exports=t.p+"img/Biggs Darklighter.f942767b.jpg"},f922:function(e,a,t){"use strict";t("96ff")}});
